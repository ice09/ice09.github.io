In short, this concept allows users to become completely independent of centralized currency systems: a scarce resource (the user&amp;rsquo;s Circles coins), which is steadily created solely based on algorithms, can be swapped between users which make sure this resource gets value due to the trust they have to the resource-owners.</description></item><item><title>Pay Robots with Crypto Money: Crypto Payable API (xDai edition)</title><link>https://ice09.github.io/pay-robots-with-crypto-money/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ice09.github.io/pay-robots-with-crypto-money/</guid><description>I need your clothes, your boots, and your motorcycle. &amp;mdash; T-1000 Wouldn't it be great?

Granted, that&amp;rsquo;s worst-case scenario. The destruction might in fact be very localized, limited to merely our own galaxy. &amp;mdash; Doc Brown If you could start a sequence of actions and - at the very end of it - could just cancel it from the beginning as if nothing ever happened, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t that be cool?</description></item><item><title>Tokenize It!
